# Lesson 09
Tuple signature: type * type * type

Discard them while deconstructing a tuple by assigning those parts to the underscore symbol: _. 

Generic types are defined as 'a

In the BCL you can use tuples instead of 'out' paramters:
    let result, parsed = Int32.TryParse(number);

Records use structural equality checking

Everything with a record must be assigned on instantiation 

Copy and update syntax:
let updatedCustomer =
    { customer with
        Age = 31
        EmailAddress = "joe@bloggs.co.uk" }      


### Lesson 11
The >> operator is used for composition.
    This composes multiple functions into one funtion as long as the return/argument types match eg:
        
### Lesson 12
Namespaces logically organise data types and modules
Namespaces cannot hold functions
Modules are like static classes in C#
Modules do not need to be a part of a namespace


[<AutoOpen>] attribute on the module can open modules automatically.

The >> operator is used for composition.
    This composes multiple functions into one funtion as long as the return/argument types match eg:
