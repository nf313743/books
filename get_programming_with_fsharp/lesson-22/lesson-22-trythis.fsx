Create a simple rules engine over the filesystem example from the previous lesson. The
engine should filter out files that donâ€™t pass certain checks, such as being over a specific
file size, having a certain extension, or being created before a specific date. Have you
ever created any rules engines before? Try rewriting them in the style we defined in this
lesson.
